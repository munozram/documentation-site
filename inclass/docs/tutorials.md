# Tutorials
*Tutorials are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind. Tutorials are learning-oriented.*

### Sum

If you want to add three numbers, say 2, -9, and 0.5. Use the function as shown below:
```
>>> my_adder( 2, -9, 0.5)
>>> -6.5
```

### Thermostat

Suppose the current temperature is 68 degrees, but the thermostat is programmed to be at 73 degrees. To determine the status of the thermostat (Heat, AC, or off), use the function as follows:
```
>>> my_thermo_stat( 68, 73 )
>>> Heat
```
