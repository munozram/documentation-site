# How-to Guides
*How-to guides are directions that take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem. How-to guides are goal-oriented.*

### Sum

If you want to add three numbers __a__, __b__, and __c__. Use the function as shown below:
```
>>> my_adder( a, b, c )
```
The function ouputs the result of adding the three numbers.

### Thermostat

Suppose the current temperature is __A__ degrees, but the thermostat is programmed to be at __B__ degrees. To determine the status of the thermostat, yo can use the function as follows:
```
my_thermo_stat( A, B )
```
With the output, this function will tell you if the status should be either Heat, AC, or off to achieve the desired temperature. Note that the difference in temperatures should be big enough to turn the heat or AC on.
